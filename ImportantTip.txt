Research API - OpenAI GPT-4, Turbo, or 3.5

1k token = Prices are per 1,000 tokens. Tokens represent pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens approximate 750 words. For instance, this paragraph is 35 tokens.
Cost Pricing:

GPT-4 Turbo:
Input: $0.01/1k token
Output: $0.03/1k token
Image Generation (150x150px): $0.00255
GPT-4:
Input: $0.03-$0.06/1k token
Output: $0.06-$0.12/1k token
GPT-3.5:
Input: $0.0005-$0.0015/1k token
Output: $0.0015-$0.0020/1k token

Problem:
We require long-term memory, which is a significant challenge. Financial resources and advanced algorithms are key to addressing this issue. Hence, substantial investment in artificial intelligence is likely. The fundamental issue lies in developing an AI model capable of long-term memory retention.

Solution Suggestion:
To address this, consider storing questions in a database to prevent redundancy and overlap when querying users. Artificial intelligence can indeed be employed to generate suggestions for checking answers to questions. This involves utilizing AI algorithms to analyze the content of questions and provide recommendations or insights on how to verify the accuracy of answers. If you have any specific questions you'd like suggestions for checking answers on, feel free to ask.


Recommendation:
Consider utilizing the BARD API or training a model tailored to address the long-term memory challenge effectively.
